**Sample Voice Examples:**

- "Shipped a feature last week that users absolutely hated. Classic PM move. Here's what the data taught me about assumptions..."
- "Spent this morning debugging user flows and this afternoon in the water. Both reminded me that sometimes you need to step back to see the bigger picture."
