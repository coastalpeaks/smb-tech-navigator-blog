# Why I'd Rather Check Surf Reports Than Sprint Reports (And What That Taught Me About Product Management)

*Or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the wipeout*

---

Hi. I'm probably not who you think I am.

I'm not here to sell you a productivity system that will "10x your output" or teach you how to "crush your Q4 goals." I won't be sharing photos of my perfectly organized workspace or my morning routine that starts at 4:47 AM with meditation and ends with a green smoothie.

Instead, I'm the guy who once skipped a crucial stakeholder meeting because the surf report showed clean 4-foot waves for the first time in weeks. I'm the PM who has shipped features that users actively complained about. I'm someone who still gets nostalgic about the satisfying *ding* of AOL Instant Messenger and remembers when "going viral" meant your computer had actual problems.

And honestly? I think that makes me more qualified to talk about building products and navigating tech careers, not less.

## The Problem with Perfect

Somewhere along the way, professional content became performance art. Open LinkedIn and you'll find a parade of people who apparently never make mistakes, never feel uncertain, and have somehow optimized their way to enlightenment. Every failure is a "learning opportunity" wrapped in inspirational quotes and stock photos of people pointing at whiteboards.

But here's what I've learned after 15+ years in product management: the best insights come from the messiest moments. The breakthrough doesn't happen during the perfectly planned ideation session—it happens when you're debugging a user flow at 11 PM and suddenly realize you've been solving the wrong problem entirely.

The best career advice doesn't come from someone who's never been confused about their next step. It comes from someone who's been lost in the woods, found their way out, got lost again, and can laugh about both experiences.

## Lessons from the Lineup

I started surfing in college, right around the same time I was taking my first computer science classes. At first glance, these seem like completely different worlds. One is about cutting-edge technology and rapid iteration; the other is about reading natural patterns and waiting for the right moment.

But the more I've done both, the more I realize they're teaching me the same lessons:

**You can't control the conditions, only your response to them.** In surfing, you can check the forecast obsessively, but ultimately you work with whatever the ocean gives you. In product management, you can research and plan endlessly, but the market will always surprise you. The skill isn't in perfect prediction—it's in adaptive response.

**Wipeouts are data, not failures.** Every surfer knows that if you're not wiping out occasionally, you're not pushing yourself hard enough. Every PM should know that if every feature launch goes perfectly, you're probably not taking enough creative risks. The wipeout isn't the problem—staying down is.

**The best sessions happen when you stop checking the forecast every five minutes.** There's a paradox in both surfing and product work: the more you obsess over metrics and conditions, the less present you become for the actual experience. Sometimes you need to put down the surf report (or the analytics dashboard) and just feel what's happening in real time.

## The Evolution I've Watched

I've been in tech long enough to remember when "responsive design" was a revolutionary concept, not a basic expectation. I've watched entire industries emerge from ideas that seemed absurd (remember when people thought no one would want to shop online?). I've seen companies rise from dorm rooms to global platforms, and watched others crash spectacularly despite having every advantage.

This perspective isn't about being old or nostalgic—it's about pattern recognition. When you've seen multiple cycles of hype and reality, boom and bust, breakthrough and backlash, you start to see the underlying currents that drive technological change. You learn to distinguish between genuine innovation and clever marketing.

Most importantly, you realize that the fundamentals haven't changed as much as we pretend they have. People still want products that solve real problems. Teams still work best when they trust each other. Good strategy still beats perfect execution of a bad idea.

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't another productivity blog. It's not a career optimization newsletter. It's not a place where I pretend to have figured everything out.

Instead, it's where I'll share what I'm actually learning—often in real time. Stories from product launches that didn't go as planned. Lessons from choosing personal life over professional advancement (and vice versa). Observations about how the industry has changed and what's stayed the same.

You'll get takes on product management that acknowledge it's equal parts art, science, and educated guessing. Career advice that admits I'm still figuring it out too. Tech industry commentary from someone who remembers when JavaScript was "just for form validation" and mobile meant WAP browsers.

And yes, you'll occasionally get surf metaphors. Because after spending years trying to separate my professional life from my personal interests, I've realized that integration beats optimization every time.

## The Real Why

Here's the truth: I'm starting this because I'm tired of pretending that professional success requires sacrificing authenticity. I'm tired of career advice that treats humans like productivity machines. I'm tired of product content that ignores the beautifully messy reality of building things people actually use.

But mostly, I'm starting this because I wish someone had told me years ago that it's okay to not have it all figured out. That the best PMs are often the ones asking questions, not just giving answers. That caring about things outside of work doesn't make you less ambitious—it makes you more interesting.

If you're early in your career and feeling overwhelmed by all the "expert" advice out there, this is for you. If you're mid-career and wondering whether there's more to professional life than hitting quarterly targets, this is for you. If you're trying to build products that matter while staying true to who you are, this is definitely for you.

And if you've ever chosen to go surfing instead of attending another meeting that could have been an email? Well, we're probably going to get along just fine.

## What's Next

Over the coming weeks, I'll be sharing stories about product decisions that seemed brilliant until users got their hands on them. Reflections on how remote work has changed team dynamics (spoiler: it's complicated). Deep dives into why understanding your users' context matters more than understanding their demographics.

I'll also be experimenting with this format, trying different types of content, and—honestly—figuring out what resonates with you. Because the best products are built through iteration, and I'm treating this blog the same way.

Got questions? Disagree with something I've said? Want to share your own wipeout stories? I'd love to hear from you. The comment section isn't just decoration—it's where the real conversation happens.

Until then, I'll be alternating between checking analytics dashboards and surf forecasts, trying to stay curious about both.
