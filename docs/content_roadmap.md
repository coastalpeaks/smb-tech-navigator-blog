# Content Roadmap: Building Momentum After Launch

## Post 2: The Feature Nobody Asked For (And the $50K Lesson It Taught Me)
**Content Pillar:** Product Management Reality Check  
**Format:** Detailed case study with actionable takeaways  
**Publishing:** 1 week after inaugural post

### Hook
"Six months ago, I convinced my team to build a feature that I was absolutely certain would revolutionize our user experience. Users hated it so much that our NPS score dropped 12 points in two weeks. Here's exactly what went wrong—and the framework I built to never make that mistake again."

### Key Content Points
- **The Setup:** Describe the feature (maybe something like an AI-powered recommendation system or automated workflow)
- **The Assumptions:** What you thought you knew about user needs
- **The Reality Check:** Actual user feedback and data
- **The Cost:** Real numbers - development time, opportunity cost, team morale
- **The Framework:** 5-question validation process you now use before any feature development
- **The Bigger Lesson:** Why being wrong fast is better than being wrong slow

### Why This Works
- Delivers on the promise of honest failure stories
- Provides actionable framework readers can use immediately
- Shows vulnerability while demonstrating growth
- Appeals to both junior PMs (learning) and senior ones (relatability)

### Content Teasers
- "The one question I wish I'd asked before building anything"
- "Why our users' silence was louder than their complaints"

## Post 3: From Dial-Up to AI: What 25 Years of "Revolutionary" Tech Taught Me About Hype Cycles
**Content Pillar:** Tech Evolution Chronicles  
**Format:** Nostalgic deep-dive with pattern analysis  
**Publishing:** 2 weeks after inaugural post

### Hook
"I've watched the internet get 'disrupted' about 47 times. From dial-up to broadband to mobile to cloud to AI—every cycle feels like the end of the world as we know it. But here's what actually changes (hint: less than you think) and what stays the same (hint: more than you'd expect)."

### Key Content Points
- **Personal Tech Timeline:** Your journey from dial-up AOL to whatever you're using now
- **The Pattern:** How each "revolution" follows similar adoption curves
- **What Actually Changed:** Real fundamental shifts vs. incremental improvements
- **What Never Changes:** Human behavior, fundamental business principles
- **Current AI Hype:** Where it fits in the pattern and what's genuinely different
- **Practical Takeaways:** How to evaluate "revolutionary" technology claims

### Specific Nostalgic Moments to Include
- Waiting 20 minutes to download one song on Napster
- The first time you used Google instead of Yahoo
- When responsive design felt impossible
- The iPhone announcement changing everything
- The first time you used ChatGPT

### Why This Works
- Taps into millennial nostalgia while providing business insight
- Positions you as someone with perspective, not just opinions
- Helps readers evaluate current tech trends more critically
- Educational for younger readers who didn't live through these transitions

## Post 4: The Day I Chose Surfing Over a Sprint Review (And Why My Team Thanked Me)
**Content Pillar:** Work-Life Integration  
**Format:** Personal story with philosophy on leadership  
**Publishing:** 3 weeks after inaugural post

### Hook
"It was Tuesday, 2 PM. Perfect offshore winds, clean 4-foot waves, and I had a sprint review in an hour. I looked at my team—stressed, burned out from a brutal quarter—and said 'Meeting's canceled. Who wants to go to the beach?' Three hours later, we had our best product discussion in months."

### Key Content Points
- **The Context:** Why the team was burned out and stressed
- **The Decision:** The exact moment and thought process
- **The Resistance:** Internal doubt and team skepticism
- **The Magic:** What happened when the team actually unplugged
- **The Insights:** Product breakthroughs that came from changing environment
- **The Framework:** When and how to break normal patterns for better outcomes
- **The Results:** How this changed team dynamics and product quality

### Why This Works
- Addresses work-life balance without generic advice
- Shows leadership through vulnerability and unconventional decisions
- Gives permission for readers to prioritize wellbeing
- Demonstrates that "soft skills" drive hard results
- Appeals to managers and individual contributors

### Content Teasers
- "The best product decisions happen outside conference rooms"
- "Why your team needs you to model boundaries, not just set them"

## Post 5: Learning Product Management from a 1990s Pager (A Love Letter to Constraints)
**Content Pillar:** Learning in Public + Tech Evolution  
**Format:** Reflection piece with modern applications  
**Publishing:** 4 weeks after inaugural post

### Hook
"My first 'smart device' was a Motorola pager that could display exactly 20 characters. No internet, no apps, no notifications—just 20 characters to communicate anything important. It was the most focused product experience I've ever had, and modern PMs should study it religiously."

### Key Content Points
- **The Pager Experience:** What it was actually like to use
- **The Constraints:** Technical limitations that forced brilliant design decisions
- **The Focus:** How limitations created clarity instead of confusion
- **Modern Parallels:** How today's "unlimited" possibilities often create worse experiences
- **The Lessons:** Specific constraints that made the pager experience superior
- **Current Applications:** How to artificially create helpful constraints in modern product development
- **The Exercise:** Framework for identifying and implementing productive constraints

### Specific Examples
- 20-character messages forced clear, essential communication
- No instant notifications created intentional check-in rhythms
- Single function (messaging) eliminated feature bloat
- Physical device created boundaries between work and personal time

### Why This Works
- Unique angle on product design principles
- Nostalgic but with practical modern applications
- Challenges current assumptions about "more is better"
- Provides actionable framework for constraint-based design

## Content Calendar Strategy

### Publishing Rhythm
- **Week 1:** Inaugural post (already created)
- **Week 2:** Feature failure story (builds trust through vulnerability)
- **Week 3:** Tech evolution perspective (establishes expertise and perspective)
- **Week 4:** Work-life integration story (shows values and leadership philosophy)
- **Week 5:** Constraint/pager post (demonstrates unique thinking and frameworks)

### Engagement Strategy
Each post should:
- End with 1-2 discussion questions for comments
- Include a "What would you do?" scenario
- Tease the next week's topic in the last paragraph
- Include a small call-to-action for newsletter signup

### Social Media Hooks
**Post 2:** "I convinced my team to build a feature that dropped our NPS 12 points. Here's the $50K lesson..."
**Post 3:** "I've watched the internet get 'disrupted' 47 times. Here's what actually changes..."
**Post 4:** "I canceled a sprint review to go surfing. My team thanked me. Here's why..."
**Post 5:** "My 1990s pager was a better product than most apps today. Here's what modern PMs can learn..."

### Building Momentum
- Each post references previous posts to create continuity
- Builds from vulnerability (post 2) to expertise (post 3) to leadership (post 4) to innovation (post 5)
- Creates anticipation for different types of content
- Establishes all four content pillars early

This roadmap gives you a month of strong
